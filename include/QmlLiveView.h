// A QML view that re-creates itself when its source files change on disk, so
// `ui_qml` module authors can nudge a margin, save, and see the result without
// rebuilding or relaunching.
//
// Why re-create rather than just re-`setSource()` the same widget: QQmlEngine's
// type cache is per-engine, and clearComponentCache() only releases compilation
// units nothing still references. A live root object, a context property or a
// replica can keep the old unit alive, in which case the reload silently replays
// the previous QML — reporting success while changing nothing. Building a fresh
// QQmlEngine each time has no cache to defeat, so what is on disk is what runs.
//
// The backend is untouched by a reload: it lives in a separate ui-host process,
// and the bridge is re-bound to the new engine's root context.
//
// Enabled only when DEV_QML_PATH pointed this view at an editable source tree.
// Set LOGOS_QML_HOT_RELOAD=0 to opt out.
